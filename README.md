## REQUIREMENTS:
We recommend the use of conda alternatively miniconda for python environment management. For the scripts, refer to the requirements.txt in the root folder, for the PConvInpainting refer to PConvInpainting/requirements.txt.


## STEP BY STEP USAGE:

- Download MSRA10K at [https://mmcheng.net/msra10k/](https://mmcheng.net/msra10k/)
- Run scripts/protocol.sh PATH ; e.g. MSRA10K_Imgs_GT/Imgs
- Run PConvInpainting/inpaintMSRA10K.py ; --help for parameter instructions
- Run scripts/featureRelated/computeKnn.py ; --help for parameter instructions
- Run scripts/featureRelated/anda.py ; --help for parameter instructions

A bash script for the entire process is available at scripts/run.sh

```
cd scripts
bash run.sh
```
